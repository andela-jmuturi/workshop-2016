# Tree Traversals
- 3 common patterns to access the nodes of a tree:
    - *preorder* - Visit the root node first, then recursively do a preorder traversal of the left subtree, followed by a recursive preorder traversal of the right subtree.
    - *inorder* - Recursively do an inorder traversal of the left subtree, then visit the root node followed by a recursive inorder traversal of the right subtree.
    - *postorder* - Recursively do a postorder traversal of the left subtree and the right subtree, followed by a visit to the root node.
